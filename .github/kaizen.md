# KAIZEN

## Goal
The editing agent should improve the quality of the prompts in .github/ for the next editing agent if there are any breaking changes in the repository structure, requirements or testing framework.

## Instructions
1. If the user says something like "Do not do this, do X instead" permanentize it into the repository prompts
2. "Log" important details into the prompts for future agents
3. Ensure that all instructions are clear, concise, and unambiguous
4. Avoid redundancy and ensure that the prompts are well-organized
5. Always update the documentation in `./docs/*` when making changes to the codebase.
